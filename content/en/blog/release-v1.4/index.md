**KubeEdge** is an open source system extending native containerized application orchestration and device management to hosts at the Edge. It is built upon Kubernetes and provides core infrastructure support for networking, application deployment and metadata synchronization between cloud and edge. It also supports MQTT and allows developers to author custom logic and enable resource constrained device communication at the Edge.

- Fix too long time to get node ready when reconnect 

- Auto detect sandbox image

- Run edgecore as system service

## **Future Outlook**

With the release of v1.4, KubeEdge provides more complete edge application monitoring and management capabilities, a more stable and reliable cloud-side collaborative transmission mechanism, a more friendly user experience, and a more friendly community contributor experience. Thanks to Huawei, China Unicom, Zhejiang University SEL Lab, ARM and other organizations for their contributions, as well as all community contributors for their support!
