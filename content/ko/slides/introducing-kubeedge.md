## KubeEdge

- {{% fragment %}} An opensource project contributed / started by Huawei. [https://github.com/kubeedge](https://github.com/kubeedge) {{% /fragment %}}  
- {{% fragment %}} KubeEdge allows customers (devOps, SRE etc.) to manage edge nodes, deploy / orchestrate / monitor apps etc. the same way as in the cloud.  {{% /fragment %}}  
- {{% fragment %}} KubeEdge contains components running at cloud and edge. ~~Currently the edge part is opensourced and cloud will be very soon~~ Both, edge and cloud parts are now opensourced. {{% /fragment %}}

## KubeEdge Roadmap

**Release 1.0**

- K8s Application deployment through kubectl from Cloud to Edge node(s)
- K8s configmap, secret deployment through kubectl from Cloud to Edge node(s) and their applications in Pod
- Bi-directional and multiplex network communication between Cloud and edge nodes
- K8s Pod and Node status querying with kubectl at Cloud with data collected/reported from Edge
- Edge node autonomy when its getting offline and recover post reconnection to Cloud
- Device twin and MQTT protocol for IOT devices talking to Edge node
