        <h3>Kubernetes</h3>
        <p>The Kubeedge project is dedicated to making an open platform, which is built upon kubernetes and provides fundamental infrastructure support
            for network, app. deployment and metadata synchronization between cloud and edge.</p>

        <h3>Docker</h3>
        <p>Building and deploying new applications is faster with containers. Docker containers wrap up software and its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development that includes everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools and libraries. This guarantees that your application will always run the same and makes collaboration as simple as sharing a container image.</p>

        <h4>Edge Computing</h4>
        <p>Significantly decrease the volumes of data that must be moved, reducing transmission costs, shrinking latency between the data and the decision, improving quality of service.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col col-16 item">
        <h4>Simplify development</h4>
        <p>Offer container runtime based application management capability, you can deployment application from your image and shield system difference. Same code can be run on a device or in cloud, and you can code in any language you know and use existing business logic without any change.</p>

        <h4>Kubernetes-Native</h4>
        <p>KubeEdge is built upon kubernetes and provides fundamental infrastructure support for network, application anagement and metadata synchronization between cloud and edge. Edge side decision, data analysis result, device status can be easily upload to cloud side for further analysis, data statistic, data visualization.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col col-16 item">
        <h4>Abundant applications</h4>
        <p>You can easily get and deploy complicate machine learning, image recognition, event processing and other high level applications to your edge side. Get them from the community, create modules and make them available to the community.</p>
